## Introduction
This is a rather basic app, i was sure to implement the following based on your request, things such as night mode, basic unit testing on both the backend and frontend, clicking on flags give all the information that was requested aswell. Overall it was a fun little project, and enjoyed writing it, I think towards the end I may have missed a few things. But I did my best with the time I had.

## How to Run

There are a few ways to get the project going.

One is the goodold and somewhat trust worthy .bat file I only had the chance to try this one once, only had one extra PC with no dependencies loaded, and it did not work, im hoping with the changes made it will work now

Plan B is to load the project in visual studio press the start button
